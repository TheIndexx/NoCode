# No Code Extension
** Note: This extension has been de-activated. It had around 150 daily users by the time of de-activation.

This extension connects to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, and allows users to directly input code from GPT and reduce time spent manually coding!

## How to Use
Once you've installed the extension, open your VSCode editor and right click. No Code should be an option, so you can open the panel and move it to the right side of the screen if it doesn't automatically open there. There's an Info dropdown text on the panel that explains how to use it, but it's pretty simple. Just type what code you'd like, and GPT-3.5 will output it directly to your script.

Yes, it's a throwaway - don't worry though, I'll still monitor it regularly.
